## README Generator
## Description
I created this project to showcase my Node.js skills. By using the FS module, I wrote files that included user input. I also used the "inquirer" package to collect user input in the terminal. Throughout the project, I learned how to inject specific text from a JavaScript file into different file types, like markdown files. I also discovered the variations between file types, such as injecting links without "a href" tags in markdown. Additionally, I learned how to import functions between JavaScript files for better code organization. I demonstrated my ability to initialize projects and install packages using "npm init" and "npm install".
